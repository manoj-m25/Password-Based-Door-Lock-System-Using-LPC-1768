# Password-Based-Door-Lock-System-Using-LPC-1768
The password-based door lock system kit is a device that has been developed to enhance  the security of a place concerned where the entry of unauthorized individuals is restricted.  The device works with the help of an LPC 1768 that has been set in such a way to  respond to a certain binary code only

One needs to arrange their Circuit in such a way that it follows what we have written in the code

LCD:

RS – P0.2
RW – GND
EN – P0.3
Data lines – P0.4 to P0.7 (4 Bit Mode)

DC Motor (Motor Driver):

Input 1 – Port 0.16
Input 2 – Port 0.17
Enable 1 – P0.18

Keypad:
